Vizualization of spending by premier league teams vs the 'Big Six'

With large teams shelling out over $100 Million on a single player in the current transfer market, the smaller teams must be much more effective with their spending on transfers to see success. Are the top teams being effective with their spending and seeing those results in the standings?

This poster aims to shed some light on this topic and hopefully provide Premier League fans and football (or soccer) fans with some insight on how the largest teams are spending their money and how well they are doing comparatively.
